Disarm the Alarm Design Doc

You're the alarm expert on a series of heists.  Each heist, you're responsible for disarming the alarms.  Early alarms are easy - snip a wire or two.  Later alarms require you to cross wires, maybe insert signals into the system.

Possible additional features include a career mode where money is preserved between heists, buying additional tools, payout dependent on speed of disarming, prompts from teammates, multiple layers of alarm systems, degrees of success, optional goals.

Randomized alarms would be an interesting feature.

Components:
Security sensors (external input, fires if any output goes low)
Timer (external input, starts at level start, goes low when time is up)
Alarm (external output, fires when any input goes high)
Diagnostic output (feedback for the user)
Multiple objectives (unlock doors, disarm cameras only, etc.)

Advanced components:
Sends pulses at regular intervals - fires if pulses are disrupted.
Some components are at remote locations.

Basic alarm has a timer wired to sensors wired to an alarm.  Cutting the timer wire fails, cutting the wire from the sensors to the alarm works.

Tools:
Multimeter to sense current
Scissors to cut wires
Wire to cross wires
More advanced components, like custom keypads, etc.?
